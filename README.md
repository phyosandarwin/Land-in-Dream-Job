**About**
---
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on **job placement statuses in developing countries** from [Job Placement Status Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/job-placement-dataset). 

For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

1. [Data Preparation and Cleaning](https://github.com/phyosandarwin/Jobmatch/blob/67408c71741bf5a087cbbba03199483cd6affe04/Data_Preparation_and_Cleaning.ipynb)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - [Numeric](https://github.com/phyosandarwin/Jobmatch/blob/38707bf6dcb011d3331f317f7b01096b5704419d/EDA%20(Numeric).ipynb)
   - [Categorical](https://github.com/phyosandarwin/Jobmatch/blob/38707bf6dcb011d3331f317f7b01096b5704419d/EDA%20(Categorical).ipynb)

**Problem Statement**
---
Which variables are the most important in predicting whether one gets hired or not?

**Problem Significance**
> Growing need for educated and talented individuals, especially in developing countries, recruiting fresh graduates is a routine practice for organizations. 
> As undergraduate students, we felt that this issue was relevant to us. 
> As individuals who are not so familiar with trends in developing countries, we decided to investigate the hiring practices of fresh graduates there. 


**Models used**
---
   >- Decision Tree Classifier
   >- Logistic Regression
   >- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  
**Conclusion/Data-driven insights**

* Logistic Regression performs the best out of the three models, especially in terms of F1 score (good balance between precision and recall)
   > features selected are SSC%, HSC%, Degree %, MBA %, and the lack of work experience
* Unexpectedly in developing countries, hiring practices have an increasing focus on work experience (although academic qualifications remain to be highly desirable) and a decreasing focus on gender for job roles.
* Our recommendations to students from LDC are:
 > 1. Do well academically across all levels
 > 2. Gain some work experience before entering the workforce, e.g. internships

**What did we learn from the project?**
---
- Use of chi-square statistic for correlation analysis of categorical varibles
- Use of F1 score, precision, recall, ROC-AUC score as model performance evaluation metrics
- Use of RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) as a feature selection technique
- Logistic regression and SVM from sklearn
- Collaborating on GitHub
